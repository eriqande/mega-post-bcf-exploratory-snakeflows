## This is the config file that determnines what analyses will
## be run on which sample subset from which parent BCF


#### MODULES SECTION

# This is what you would use on Alpine
#Rmodule: "R/4.2.2"

# This is what you would use on SEDNA
Rmodule: "R/4.0.3"




#### DEFINITIONS SECTIONS #####

# every BCF file used here must correspond to the same
# reference genome and thus to the same scaffold groups file.
# These are identified here:
fai_path: .test/resources/genome.fasta.fai
scaff_group_path: .test/resources/scaffold_groups.tsv



# this is the short name and the path to the BCF file that will be used
# the key here (testy) corresponds to wildcard {bcf_id}.  The sample subsets
# should, of course, correspond to a particular
# bcf file, so they go here.  If there are meta data files for association
# studies in ANGSD, these go here as the dotsample.
bcf:
  testy:
    path: ".test/resources/100_fish.bcf"
    sample_subsets:
      all:
        path: .test/sample_subsets/all-fish.txt     #  all 100 fish
        dotsample: .test/data/dot-samples-all.tsv
      males:
        path: .test/sample_subsets/males.txt    # just the males
        dotsample: .test/data/dot-samples-males.tsv
      females:
        path: .test/sample_subsets/females.txt  # just the females
        dotsample: .test/data/dot-samples-females.tsv 


# same thing here, we can define different sets of bcftools filters
# that we might want to use, and we give them nicknames. The 
# nicknames/keys here correspond to wildcard

#### PARAMETERS SECTION
# Here we can give some short names for different sets of parameters
# that we will use later for particular ultimate targets

# these are all the standard parameters in the file paths

#### TARGETS SECTION

# here we have a shorthand for describing target outputs.
# Each output is defined by a triple: [A, B, C] that lives under
# a heading which says which kind of analysis is desired.
# where 
#   - A is a nickname from main_params
#   - B is a nickname for a subsample that is appropriate to the BCF in A
#   - C is a nickname for the parameters defined in params for the particular analysis
#
# The idea here is that each of these triples can be used to define a file name
# or possibly multiple filenames.
